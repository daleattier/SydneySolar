# SydneySolar
A visualisation created to view the uptake of Solar Panels in Sydney.

<h1>Solar Data</h1>
		
		<p>As part of a government initiative the NSW government ran a power bonus scheme between 2010 and 2016. The data from the scheme gives an insight into which 
		suburbs are purchasing solar power panels. By combining the solar data with the census data, we get a picture of the households purchasing solar panels and 
		perhaps an idea of where future subsidies and incentives can be targeted to improved solar power uptake. </p>

		<h1>Data Sources</h1>


		<p>There were two main sources of data, the NSW Government Open Data website (data.nsw.gov.au) and Australian Bureau of Statistics (www.abs.gov.au/census)</p>

		<h1>Solar Bonus Scheme</h1>


		<p>The NSW Solar Bonus Scheme (SBS) provides a feed-in tariff for eligible customers with small-scale solar or wind generators that are connected to the grid. 
			The program commenced on 1 January 2010 and will end on 31 December 2016. Data is available for more than 147,000 households and small businesses.</p>
		
		<h1>Census Data Packs</h1>


		<p>Census Data Packs contain comprehensive data about people, families and dwellings for all available geographic areas, with associated Geographic Information
		System digital boundary files. The packs contain 608 rows of data covering all the NSW postcodes, there are approximately 7942 variables which are based on the 
		questions from the census.</p>
